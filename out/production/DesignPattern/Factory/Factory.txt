FACTORY

+Factory
    A component responsible solely for the wholesale creation of objects.


+Motivation
    Objects creation logic become too convoluted

    Constructor os not descriptive
        ->Name mandated by name of containing type
        ->Cannot overload with same sets of arguments with different names
    Wholesale object creation(non-piecewise, unlike Builder) can be outsourced to
        ->A separated function(Factory Method->usually static; can have arbitrary name)
        ->A separated class(Factory)
        ->A hierarchy of factories with Abstract Factory(-> Makes it correspondence between a hierarchy of objects in a hierarchy of factories which are used to construct thoes objects)
