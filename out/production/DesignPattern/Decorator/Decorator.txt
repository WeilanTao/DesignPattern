Decorator
    Facilitates the additionof behaviors to individual objects without inheriting from them.

    +Keeps a reference to the decorated object(s)
    +May or may not forward calls
        Delegated Members
    +Exist in a static variation
    +Very limited to
        Type erasure
        Inability to inherit from type parameters

Motivation:
    +We want to augment an object with additional functionality
    +We don't want to rewrite or alter existing code(OCP)
    +We want to keep new functionality separate(SRP)
    +Need to be able to interact with existing structures
