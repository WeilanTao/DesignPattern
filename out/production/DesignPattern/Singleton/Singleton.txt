SINGLETON

+Singleton
    A component which is instantiated only once

    Making a 'safe' singleton is easy:
        construct a static Lazy<T> and return its value

    Instead of directly using a singleton, consider depending on an abstraction(e.g. an interface)

    Consider defining singleton lifetime in DI container

+Motivation
    -> For some components it only make sense to have one in the system
            Database repository
            Object factory
    -> The constructor call is expensive and we only do it once
            we  only do it once;
            we provide everyone with the same instance
    -> Want to prevent anyone creating additional copies
    -> Need to take care of lazy instantiation and thread safety
