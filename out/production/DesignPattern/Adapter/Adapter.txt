ADAPTER

Adapter
    Getting the interface you want from the interface you have (像转换器一样)

    Adapts an existing interface X to conform to the required interface Y.

    ->Determine the API you have and the API you need
    ->Creating a component which aggregates(聚合) the adaptee
    ->Intermediate representation can pile up~use caching
