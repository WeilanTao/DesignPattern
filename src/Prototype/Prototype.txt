PROTOTYPE

+Prototype:
    A partially or fully initialized object that you clone and make use of.

    To implement a prototype:
    -> Partially construct an object and store it somewhere;
    -> Clone the prototype
        ->Implement your owen deep copy; or Serialize and Deserialize
    -> Customize the resulting instance.

+Motivation
    -> An existing (partially or fully constructed) design is a prototype
    -> We make a deep copy(clone) of the prototype and customize it
