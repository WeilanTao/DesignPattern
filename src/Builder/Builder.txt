BUILDER
+Builder
    A builder is a separate component for building an object. When piecewise object construction is complicated, provide anAPI for doing it succinctly.

    Can either give builder a constructor or return it via a static function.

    To make builder fluent, return this.

    Different facets of an object can be built with different builders woking in tandem via a base class.




+Motivation:
    Some Objects are simple and can be created in a single constructor call

    Other objects require a lot of ceremony to create.

    Having an object with 10 constructor arguments is not productive

    Instead, opt for piecewise construction.

    Builder provides an API for constructing an object step-by-step
