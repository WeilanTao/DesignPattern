FLYWEIGHT

Flyweight:
    A Space optimization technique tha lets us uses less memory by storing externally the data associated with similar objects
    
    +Store common data externally
    +Specify an index or a reference into the extrenal data store

Motivation:
    Avoid redundancy when storing data
        e.g. For MMORPG:
                Plenty of users with identical first/last usernames
                -> Store a list of names and pointers/indexs to them
        e.g. For bold or italic text in the console:
                Don't want each character to have a formatting character
                -> Operate on ranges( e.g. line numbers; start/end positions )
