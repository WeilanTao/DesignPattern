SINGLETON

+Singleton
    A component which is instantiated only once



+Motivation
    -> For some components it only make sense to have one in the system
            Database repository
            Object factory
    -> The constructor call is expensive and we only do it once
            we  only do it once;
            we provide everyone with the same instance
    -> Want to prevent anyone creating additional copies
    -> Need to take care of lazy instantiation and thread safety
